     Link11 is the PDP-11 linker used at CMU instead of  DEC's LNKX11
for  linking (on  the PDP-10)  files produced  by MACX11,  MACY11, or
MACN11.

     Link11 differs  from LNKX11 in  several respects, most  of which
are extensions.  The most noticeable of the changes are:
        1) DDT-11 support, including creation of symbol tables
        2) Graphic Monitor support for the GDP-2
        3) Support for L*, a language(?) designed at CMU
        4) Compatable with the TOPS-10 monitor CCL feature
        5) Maintained at CMU -- bugs can be fixed (see Rick Gumpertz)

     If  called  via  the  COMPIL CUSP  (CCL),  the  command  line is
automatically created and passed  to Link11 by that program.   If run
directly, Link11 prompts on the TTY with a version number and  a "*".
The user should then type a command line, which is of the form:
        BINFIL,MAPFIL=OBJFIL1,OBJFIL2,...,OBJFILn/SWITCH1.../SWITCHm
The character "‚Üê"  may be substituted for  "=" and the  character "%"
for "/". On  the right side  of the "=",  "+" may be  substituted for
",".  In addition, several  switches may be enclosed  in parentheses,
separated by spaces.  Spaces in the command line are usually ignored.

     Command files may be inserted by including CMDFIL@ or @CMDFIL in
the command  line.  Line numbers,  line boundaries, etc.  are ignored
when  reading a  command-file.   There is  no explicit  limit  to the
number of command files allowed or to the depth of nesting thereof.

     The following switches are currently defined:
/T      Tell the user on his TTY various information as Link11 runs
/T:n    Set  the transfer  address to  n (octal)  (note that  this is
        totally different from /T without a ":"!)
/B:n    Set  the initial  load address  to n  (octal) instead  of the
        default which is 10000 (must not be used with /M)
/B      Equivalent to /B:0 which is probably not useful
/D:n    Load DDT at the end of the program; put n null symbols in the
        symbol table (n currently octal, will be changed to decimal)
/D      Equivalent to /D:5
/L      Produce a .MAP  file even if no  MAPFIL was specified  in the
        command line (useful with CCL)
/P      Produce a .LDA file instead  of .BIN (This is the  default in
        LNKX11) (same as .BIN but packed format)
/M      Produce a  .LNK file  instead of  .BIN, suitable  for loading
        with the Graphic Monitor
/G      Load   into   GDP-2   double-port   memory   (Graphic  space)
        (meaningful only together with /M)
/S      Suppress internal symbols to  save space (i.e don't  put them
        in the DDT symbol table)
/$      Like  /S,  but  suppress  only  those  symbols  whose  second
        character  is  "$"  (used  to  suppress   Bliss-11  generated
        symbols)



/U      Enable  special processing  for University  of  California at
        Berkeley
/*      Enable L* processing
/E      Ignored for LNKX11 compatability
/C      Produce a "ComDir"  at the front  of the output  file (Always
        done in LNKX11)

     This paragraph explains some of the nitty-gritty of  DDT support
for anyone who  cares.  Most users will  simply say /D and  not worry
any further  about it.   If DDT is  present, a  symbol table  will be
produced at  the address  indicated by the  GLOBAL symbol  D.SYMT.  A
user may use  his own version  of DDT simply  by including it  in the
command string instead of the /D switch.  To cause Link11  to realize
that DDT is present, the  GLOBALs "DDT" and "JOBSA" must  be defined.
D.SYMT will be defined at the end of the program if it is not already
defined.  Since the system DDT  defines D.SYMT at its end,  it should
always be loaded last.   (Otherwise the symbol table  would overwrite
the  program!) This  is guaranteed  by the  /D switch.   The location
indicated by  the GLOBAL  JOBSA will be  overwritten with  what would
have  been the  transfer address  if DDT  had not  been  loaded.  The
actual transfer address will be  DDT, so that DDT will be  run before
the user program.  The symbol table passed to DDT includes all GLOBAL
symbols (including  .CSECT names).   If .ENABL  ISD was  specified in
MACN11, local symbols will also  be put in the symbol  table, subject
to restrictions by  the /S and /$  switches.  In addition,  any local
symbols with the same name as previously encountered symbols  will be
ignored.  The symbols R0-R7, SP, and PC are ignored since  the system
DDT already handles  the normal register  names in a  special manner.
Other register symbols are defined using the assumption that JOBSA is
just after an array of 8 words where DDT keeps the  user's registers.
The  location indicated  by the  GLOBAL JOBDDT,  if defined,  will be
overwritten with the  address in DDT which  may be called with  a JSR
PC,@JOBDDT (this address is DDT+2).  The system DDT leaves this to be
defined  by  the  user if  he  wants  it.  This  allows  the  user to
initialize the location  JOBDDT with the address  of a routine  to be
called if DDT is not present.
