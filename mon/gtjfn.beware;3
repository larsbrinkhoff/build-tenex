Following are several known problems associated with or discovered
while making the SMXGTJ changes to GTJFN.

1)  EXEC
  a)  ? should be added to the EXEC break table to go to GTJFN when file
	names are input so the ? feature in GTJFN is invoked (Hedberg
	has the EXEC change reference).  Note that if ? is the first
	input character to GTJFN, it will give an error break.

  b)  INTERROGATE doesn't know about the extended wild cards yet for
	searching archive directories.
	
  c)  The EXEC does GTJFN for DIR commands with the IGDLF flag (1B8) on
	and sorts out deleted files from undeleted files later.  Thus,
	even though a fix was made in GNJFN for scanning when recent
	file versions are deleted, the DIR command still omits files
	with deleted recent versions.  In the sequence

		FOO.1;1
		FOO.2;2 (deleted)
		FOO.2;1
		FOO.3;1

	the DIR FOO.*;0 command to list all most recent versions will
	omit FOO.2 entirely.

  d)  ^V is eaten by the EXEC when passing an input string down to
	GTJFN (any string consumer).  For example if a file TTY:.;1
	is created by some DEC program, one would think this should
	be deleted by DEL TTY^V:.;1 but the EXEC eats the ^V and
	doesn't pass it with the file name string.  One has to type
	2 ^V's to get the desired result.  This is a long standing
	bug and has nothing to do with GTJFN.

2)  BSYS

  a)  In the long GTJFN tables at RSTTBL: and DMPTBL:, string pointers
	for DMPDEV and DMPDIR are in the form  0,,ADR  rather than
	legitimate TENEX string pointers.  GTJFN now checks for valid
	string pointers and these forms must be changed to  -1,,ADR.

  b)  BSYS doesn't know about extended wild cards yet in specifying
	files for retrieval, etc.
